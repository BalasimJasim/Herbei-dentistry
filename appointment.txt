Appointment System Workflow
User Flow:
The user clicks on the "Book Appointment" button.
They are redirected to the Appointment Page.
The user selects a Service (e.g., root canal, cleaning, crown preparation, etc.).
After selecting the service, the user chooses an Available Date.
Next, the user selects an Available Time Slot for that service (ensuring no overlap for the same cabinet or specialist at the same time).
The user fills in their Personal Information (Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.).
Once completed, the user receives a Confirmation via SMS and Email.

Instructions for Implementation
Dynamic Service Selection:

When the user selects a service, ensure that the system maps the service to the correct cabinet and displays only the available dates and time slots for that cabinet.
Prevent Appointment Overlaps:

Ensure that two users cannot book an appointment for the same cabinet or specialist at the same time slot. This requires backend logic to check and block conflicting time slots.
UI/UX Design:

The appointment page should follow this logical flow:
Service selection at the top.
Date picker below the service selection.
Time slot picker below the date picker.
Personal information form at the end.
Ensure the design is user-friendly, clean, and responsive.
Calendar and Time Slots:

Make the calendar functional to display only available dates based on the cabinetâ€™s schedule.
Ensure time slots are dynamically loaded and show availability for the selected service and date.
Confirmation System:

After the user completes the booking, send a confirmation SMS and email. Use the existing email and SMS functionality, and ensure it integrates seamlessly with the booking system.
Validation:

Add validation for user inputs (e.g., required fields, valid email/phone format).
Display error messages for unavailable time slots or incorrect inputs.
Testing:

Test the appointment system thoroughly to ensure:
No overlapping appointments.
Correct cabinet allocation based on service.
SMS and email confirmations are sent successfully.
